look
pull
use
ask

AUX:

search google for seattle
do a google search on seattle # this works because we ignore all the in between stuff like 'search'
go ahead and google seattle
look up seattle on google
pull up search results for seattle
use google to search for seattle

get a youtube video of seattle
get a video on youtube of seattle

get the news
take a screenshot
news

computer do you like sports
open facebook

RULES:
i_keys are overriden by t_keys at any point
once a t_key is set, all other t_keys are ignored. # there is a workaround for cases where latter t_keys are intended
once an action verb is set, all other action verbs are ignored

CORNER:
use youtube to search for seattle
