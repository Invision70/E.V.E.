{"name":"E.V.E.","tagline":"a jarvis computer written in Python.","body":"E.V.E.\r\n======\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n-----------\r\nE.V.E. is a talking Jarvis computer. Say \"okay computer\" when it is running to activate listening, and then you can tell it to do what you want.\r\n\r\nE.V.E. accepts natural questions and commands, such as:\r\n\r\n* \t\"What was the temperature in London on the 13th July 1982?\"\r\n* \t\"Get me a YouTube video of the Star Trek Into Darkness trailer\"\r\n* \t\"What sports do you like to play?\" \r\n\r\nSee 'Usage' for a full list of what E.V.E. can do.\r\n\r\nThis project was cloned from a [similar project](https://github.com/rob-mccann/Pi-Voice) by Rob McCann.\r\n\r\nThe project is developed for Linux, but has the potential to be multi-platform. Perhaps you can help!\r\n\r\n\r\nDependencies\r\n------------\r\n*\tjulius and julius-voxforge packages\r\n*\tffmpeg package\r\n*\tpython: pyaudio\r\n*\tpython: requests\r\n*\tpython: pydub\r\n*\tpython: PyAIML\r\n\r\nOther requirements:\r\n*\tWolfram Alpha API key\r\n*\tInternet connection and web browser\r\n*\tA microphone\r\n\r\nSee 'Installation' for detailed installation instructions.\r\n\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\nRun the project by entering 'python eve.py' into the terminal in the E.V.E. directory.\r\nE.V.E. will start up and then listen for a spoken activation command (e.g. 'Okay Computer').\r\n\r\nNote: You may find several lines of ALSA error messages after starting up eve.py. If the error messages do not terminate the program and return to the terminal prompt, then EVE can accept commands and function normally. The errors do not affect the running of the program, and I am working on removing the messages. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Activation Commands:\r\n\r\n#### \"Okay Computer\" \r\nE.V.E. will listen for a voice command, which is described in further detail below. \r\n\r\n#### \"Computer Power Down\" \t\t\r\nE.V.E. will shut down.\r\n\r\n#### \"Thanks Darling\" \t\t\r\nE.V.E. will accept the thanks and listen for another activation command.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Voice Commands:\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, the program is able to understand more naturally structured queries than the ones listed below. This feature is still experimental, but for the most part you can utter commands in conversational language:\r\n\r\n*\t'find me a youtube video of Rick Astley'\r\n*\t'I need some study music, please play the Beatles'\r\n\r\nOne restriction that still exists is that you should not say anything conversational or extraneous at the end of your input, as that will become appended to your query.\r\n\r\n#### \"open [webpage]\" \r\nopens specified webpage.\r\n\r\n#### \"google/search [query]\"\r\ngoogles specified query.\r\n\r\n#### \"youtube [query]\"\r\nplays first youtube video returned by query.\r\n\r\n#### \"youtube search [query]\"\r\nreturns list of videos found by query.\r\n\r\n#### \"Computer, [query]\"\r\nConversational AI responds to query\r\n\r\n#### \"[query]\"\r\nruns query against wolfram alpha. If wolfram does not find a response, the conversational AI will respond. As a result, you can ask conversational questions such as \"do you like sports?\" directly as a voice command, without needing to prefix it with 'computer'.\r\n\r\n#### \"radio [artist]\"\r\nopens Last.fm radio to play similar artists. (Current music streaming solutions all require premium accounts. Last.fm radio doesn't even require user authentication)\r\n\r\n#### \"...no stop...\"\r\naccidental recording; do nothing.\r\n\r\n#### \"..screenshot...\"\r\ntakes a screenshot\r\n\r\n#### \"...news...\"\r\nopens a news website of your choosing (default is currently set to Bing News as I personally think the layout is really good. But you can change it to whatever you want!)\r\n\r\n#### \"change news source\"\r\nthis command takes precedence over the one above. The program will prompt you for a new news url.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation \r\n------------\r\nThese installation instructions work for Ubuntu Linux.\r\n\r\n#### Install building tool chain:\r\n`$ sudo apt-get install build-essential`\r\n\r\n#### Install julius and julius voxforge:\r\n`$ sudo apt-get install julius julius-voxforge`\r\n\r\n#### Download and install portaudio\r\n[from here](http://www.portaudio.com/download.html)\r\n\r\n#### Install ffmpeg (for pydub):\r\n`$ sudo apt-get install ffmpeg`\r\n\r\n#### Install python packages using pip:\r\n`$ pip install -r requirements.txt`\r\n\r\n#### Install pyaiml\r\n\t$ git clone git://pyaiml.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/pyaiml/pyaiml\r\n\t$ python setup.py install\r\n\r\n#### Getting a Wolfram Alpha API Key(AppID):\r\n1. [Sign up for a wolfram alpha account](https://developer.wolframalpha.com/portal/apisignup.html)\r\n2. Request an API key(AppID)\r\n3. In the terminal, 'export WOLFRAM_API_KEY='AAAAAA-AAAAAAAAAA''\r\n\r\n#### Run E.V.E.:\r\n\t$ git clone https://github.com/thomasweng15/E.V.E..git\r\n\t$ python eve.py\r\n\r\n#### Other Setup:\r\n\tEnsure that your microphone is set up and that the input volume \r\n\tis not too low or too high. You can check this using the \"Sound\" \r\n\tutility in your settings menu under the \"Input\" tab.\r\n\r\nInstallation complete! Take a look at \"Usage\" to run the program!\r\n\r\n\r\nNext Steps\r\n----------\r\n1. \tmake screenshot storage location variable and store the path in datafile.txt.\r\n2.  provide Arduino communication/control as an action to be triggered by voice command.\r\n3. \tdesign a GUI! \r\n\r\n\r\nContributors\r\n------------\r\n*\tThomas Weng\r\n*\tTevin Zhang\r\n*\tRob McCann\r\n            ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
